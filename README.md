# Data-Driven-Stock-Analysis-Organizing-Cleaning-and-Visualizing-Market-Trends
### Project Description

The **Nifty 50 Stock Performance Dashboard** is an end-to-end analytics and visualization solution designed to empower investors, analysts, and traders with actionable insights into the performance trends of Nifty 50 companies over the past year. This project processes granular, daily-level stock data to highlight top/worst performers, examine sector trends, measure volatility, and enable comparative analysis—all through interactive dashboards built with Streamlit and Power BI.

### Project Objectives

- **Stock Ranking:** Identify the top 10 best-performing (green) and worst-performing (red) Nifty 50 stocks based on yearly returns.
- **Market Overview:** Summarize overall market health and provide key indicators such as average returns, green/red stock ratios, and average volume.
- **Investment Insights:** Help investors spot growth opportunities and avoid risk by displaying consistent gainers and losers.
- **Risk & Correlation Analysis:** Visualize stock volatility and correlation to inform more nuanced portfolio strategies.
- **Sector Trends:** Offer sector-wise breakdowns to guide investment in high-performing industries.
- **Time-Based Trends:** Allow users to observe monthly themes, identifying the best and worst stocks on a month-by-month basis.

### Key Features

- **Automated Data Pipeline**: Extract, clean, and structure daily stock data from hierarchical YAML files into analysis-ready CSV and SQL tables.
- **Metrics Computation**: Calculate returns, volatility, cumulative gains, sector-level averages, and price correlations.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Use Streamlit for a real-time, web-based interface, and Power BI for in-depth, interactive reports.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### 1. Data Extraction & Transformation

**Input**: Monthly folders contain YAML files with date-wise stock data.

**Process**:
- Write a Python script to recursively parse all YAML files.
- For each symbol (stock ticker), extract daily entries (open, close, high, low, volume).
- Transform and save each symbol's data as a CSV file (`symbol.csv`), resulting in 50 separate CSVs.
- Optionally, use Pandas to concatenate and standardize all symbol CSVs into a **master DataFrame** for further analysis.

### 2. Database Integration

- Create a MySQL/PostgreSQL database schema with tables for daily prices, returns, and sector mapping.
- Use SQLAlchemy to store cleaned and transformed data in the SQL database.
- Index tables by symbol, date, and sector for efficient querying.

### 3. Data Analysis & Insights Generation (Python + Pandas)

- **Yearly Performance**: Compute total return for each stock over the year.
- **Top/Bottom Performer Identification**: Sort and select the top 10 green and red stocks.
- **Summary Metrics**: Calculate the average return and volume across the market; find counts of green/red stocks.
- **Volatility**: Calculate daily returns and standard deviation for each stock; extract 10 most volatile stocks.
- **Cumulative Return**: Generate a running total of returns for top 5 performers.
- **Sector Mapping**: Use sector CSV to associate each stock with a sector, then compute sector-wise averages.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Use Pandas `.corr()` to determine relationships among closing prices; create a correlation matrix.
- **Month-wise Top 5s**: For each month, compute monthly returns and identify month’s top gainers and losers.

### 4. Visualization

#### Power BI
- Import cleaned data/SQL tables into Power BI.
- Create reports for:
  - Top gainers/losers (bar charts)
  - Volatility analysis (bar charts)
  - Sector-wise performance (bar/column charts)
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Monthly performance breakdowns

#### Streamlit
- Build an interactive dashboard enabling users to:
  - Filter by stock, sector, or date.
  - View dynamic charts on top performers, volatility, returns, and sector summaries.
  - Interact with correlation and monthly gainers/losers charts.
